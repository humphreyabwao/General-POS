## üéØ How It Works

### Data Flow:

2. **Cache Management** - Stores customer data in `customersCache`
3. **Filter & Sort** - Applies filters to create `filteredCustomers`
4. **Display** - Renders table rows from filtered data
5. **Statistics** - Auto-calculates and updates stat cards

### Database Structure (Firebase):
```
customers/
  {id1}/
    name: "John Doe"
    email: "john@example.com"
    phone: "+254712345678"
    address: "123 Main St"
    city: "Nairobi"
    status: "active"
    type: "retail"
    notes: "Premium customer"
    totalOrders: 5
    totalSpent: 25000
    createdAt: "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    updatedAt: "2025-01-20T14:00:00Z"
```
